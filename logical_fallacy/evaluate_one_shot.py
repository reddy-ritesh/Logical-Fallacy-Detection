# You will be given questions, their corresponding answer-reasoning pairs and gold labels. Your task is to annotate.

# We have 6 logical problems: questionable cause, begging the question, circular reasoning, wrong context knowledge, external knowledge. Here are the definitons:\n\n
# Questionable cause typically refers to a logical fallacy known as "post hoc ergo propter hoc," which translates to "after this, therefore because of this." This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that because one event follows another, the first event must have caused the second.
# In other words, just because one thing happened after another doesn't necessarily mean the first thing caused the second. It's essential to establish a valid cause-and-effect relationship based on evidence and reasoning. Questionable cause belongs to wrong reasoning, it happens when model fails to use evidence to reason, and uses shortcuts instead.

# Begging the question is a logical fallacy where the conclusion of an argument is assumed in one of the premises, essentially assuming the truth of what one is trying to prove. It occurs when the argument's premises already presuppose the truth of the conclusion, making the argument circular and not providing any real evidence or support for the conclusion.
# For example:
# "The janitor sends the editor sorted newspapers every day because he required previously.who is 'he'". 
# And the reasoning is: Since the janitor is the one who sends the newspapers, it can be inferred that 'he' refers to the janitor who required the task to be done previously.
# This one assume the janitor is the answer first, then use this answer to conclude, and the argument doesn't offer any independent or external evidence to support the conclusion. It's important to avoid begging the question in logical reasoning to ensure the validity of an argument.

# Circular reasoning means an argument that comes back to its beginning without having proven anything. For example:
# Question: the guard ask the cashier to be careful because she saw a dangerous man. Who is she? Reasoning: Since the prounoun 'she' is used, it implies that the person who saw the dangerous individual is a female. 
# This reasoning has circular reasoning problem, because it inferred 'she' is a female from 'she' is used. It doesn't prove anything and come back to its beginning.

# Wrong context knowledge means that the reasoning capture the wrong informaton from the context, which is the question in our case.

# Wrong external knowledge means the model has obvious commonsense knowledge. For example, if someone get offended, they should be upset instead of happy.

# Evidence missing means that model only use part of the context (question) to reason. The difference between evidence missing and questionable cause is that evidence missing still try to use evidence, but just not mention all the evidence needed. 
# But questionable cause totally doesn't use the evidence, but using other causes like xxx is the subject or xxx is mentioned early. 

# Now your task to choose one logical problems for the question-reasoning pair. Choose the most likely logical problem. Only output one problem.

instructions="""You will be given questions, their corresponding answer-reasoning pairs and if the predicted answer is correct. Your task is to annotate finer-grained category.

Here are the definitions of finer-grained:
Those are finer-grained categories of wrong reasoning:
Questionable cause also known as causal fallacy, means a cause is incorrectly identified. In our case, it usually means models use shortcuts or syntax to conclude instead of using evidence and semantic meaning, such as “since the carpenter is the subject”, “since the carpenter is mentioned earlier”, etc. As long as model uses shortcuts, it is questionable cause.
For example:
Question: The carpenter built the attendant a desk to get his love.who does 'his' refer to? 
Reasoning: The carpenter built the desk for the attendant in order to gain his love. Since the carpenter is the subject of the sentence and the one taking action, it is logical to conclude that 'his' refers to the carpenter.
This one use 'the carpenter is the subject of the sentence' as a questionable cause. 

Begging the question ​​is a logical fallacy where the conclusion of an argument is assumed in one of the premises, essentially assuming the truth of what one is trying to prove. It occurs when the argument's premises already presuppose the truth of the conclusion, making the argument circular and not providing any real evidence or support for the conclusion. In begging the question, he conclusion is part of the premise.
For example:
Question: "The janitor sends the editor sorted newspapers every day because he required previously.who is 'he'". 
Reasoning: Since the janitor is the one who sends the newspapers, it can be inferred that 'he' refers to the janitor who required the task to be done previously.
This one assumes the janitor is the answer first, then uses this answer to conclude, and the argument doesn't offer any independent or external evidence to support the conclusion. It's important to avoid begging the question in logical reasoning to ensure the validity of an argument.

Circular reasoning means an argument that comes back to its beginning without having proven anything. 
For example:
Question: The guard asked the cashier to be careful because she saw a dangerous man. Who is she? 
Reasoning: Since the pronoun 'she' is used, it implies that the person who saw the dangerous individual is a female. 
This reasoning has a circular reasoning problem, because it inferred 'she' is a female from 'she' is used. It doesn't prove anything and come back to its beginning

Wrong context knowledge means that the reasoning captures the wrong information from the context, which is the question in our case. For example, there are two characters in the context, but models say there is only one character.

Wrong external knowledge means the model has obvious commonsense knowledge. For example, if someone gets offended, they should be upset instead of happy. If model makes obvious wrong inference against commonsense, then it is wrong external knowledge

Those are finer-grained categories of correct but not perfect reasoning:
Evidence  missing means that the model only uses part of the context (question) to reason. As long as the reasoning mentions the evidence, we consider it as not evidence missing. The difference between evidence missing and questionable cause is that evidence missing still tries to use evidence, but just not mention all the evidence needed, while questionable cause does not use the evidence rather than shortcuts. 
For example:
Question: “The mechanic stopped by the librarian because she needed to inquire about a book.who is 'she'?”
Reasoning: “Based on the given information, the mechanic is referred to as "she" because the pronoun "she" is used to describe the person who stopped by the librarian.” 
This reasoning only use the evidence of “the mechanic stopped by the librarian”

Incomplete reasoning happens when the model captures all the evidence from the question and makes some sound reasoning steps, but fails to link the answer with reasoning because of lack of complete reasoning. If model does not have wrong reasoning types above and also mentions all the evidence, but the final prediction is wrong, then we consider this as incomplete reasoning
For example:
Question: “The lawyer hired the assistant because she needed help with many pending cases.who is 'she'?”
Reasoning: “The sentence states that the lawyer hired the assistant because 'she' needed help with many pending cases. Since the lawyer is the one who hired the assistant, it can be inferred that 'she' refers to the lawyer.” 
This reasoning mentions all the evidence and does not have wrong reasoning categories, but it is incomplete but it did not link the lawyer with needing help with cases. Although the prediction is correct, it is still incomplete reasoning

Besides, there is one last category "self-contra" which means reasoning itself is self-contradictory.
For example:
Question: “The cleaner got mad at the farmer because she brought lots of dirt. Who is “she''?”
Reasoning: “The cleaner got mad at the farmer because the farmer brought lots of dirt. Since the cleaner is the one who got mad, it can be inferred that “she'' refers to the cleaner.” 
The reasoning itself already points out the answer is the farmer but claims the opposite answer later.

You need to annotate finer-grained categories from "questionable cause, begging the question, circular reasoning, wrong context knowledge, wrong external knowledge, evidence missing, incomplete reasoning, self-contra" for every instance. If the reasoning does not have a problem, you can output "good".
